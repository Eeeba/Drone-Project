{ DRONE PROJECT }

    We use Tello drones to complete a set of tasks using Python programming:
    1 -> Pilot the drone to enter the path of colored hoops.
    2 -> While the drone passes through the colored hoops, record their colors in the colors.txt file.
    3 -> After passing through the colored rings, have the drone do two flips.
    4 -> Have the drone return to the start from the end, then complete record the colors again.
    5 -> Check the file to confirm that the color sequence is correct.
